This website can help with keeping track of your expenses and income to make sure you are on track!


## Description
This is my third website just to learn website design and coding and my second one using JS. It is not connected or affiliated with any other websites or people. This website can help with keeping track of your expenses and income to make sure you are on track to save your money! Here is the link to the website: https://saanvi4800.github.io/Expense-Tracker/

## Navigating the website
This website is pretty simple, with a main dashboard where the user can input their expenses and income and get an overview of their spending habits through a balance, income, and expense section. In addition the ability to remove transactions is helpful in case you bought something you returned, one example among many. A quick note is that in this program when you remove a transaction it will count that as extra income/expense depending on what your transaction was. The logic is that if for example you spend money and then return the item it is like making money and vice versa!

## How I made this project
I created this project to further my website coding and development as well as design and I really learned a lot. I also wanted to further my javaScript coding and this project gave me an oppurtunity to do just that. I also liked the idea of customizing it to me because I know that there are many projects just like mine. That gave me the oppurtunity to create it so I could use it in my everyday life. I also created this website to submit for the athena awards program. I did struggle a lot with this project although it seems like a simple website, due to not being crazy familiar with JS to begin with. I do think that this project has furthered my ability personally to code from scratch in JS. If I had to redo this project there would certainly be parts where I could move along faster and understand better now. It was quite frusterating getting the code to do what I wanted and constantly moving back and forth to see if what I changed worked. I also am planning to make updates to my code periodically as well as I ge better at JS! All in all however I genuinely believe that I got a lot out of this project in terms of knowledge and I 100% will be using this project myself.
